This is a test program for C.
It's a very simple chess program.
You can use it and edit it if you'd like, but it would be cool if you gave credit.
Uhhhhhhh I think that's it. Sorry about the spaghetti code, it's my third program in C after hello world and tic tac toe, so I'm still getting used to it.
